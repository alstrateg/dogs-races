- There's a create view (path: /dogs/new), showing a form, to add a new dog.

- There's an update view (path: /dogs/edit/:id), showing a form, to update the dog with a given id.

- Very basic styling, content should have a width of 600px, or 300px if the device has a width of less than 620px.

- Button to delete (list view) should be its own component (demonstrate inter-component communication).

- List page should have a loading, and an error states. Add tests for list page.

- Use flexbox for positioning.
