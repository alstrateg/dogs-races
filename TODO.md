- There's an update view (path: /dogs/edit/:id), showing a form, to update the dog with a given id.

- Button to delete (list view) should be its own component (demonstrate inter-component communication).

- List page should have a loading, and an error states. Add tests for list page.

- Use flexbox for positioning.
